            <div class="collapse" id="traffic">
              <p>As I've been attending community meetings and meeting individual residents a piece of feedback I keep receiving is that traffic is a problem that faces us all.  I to know the woes of traveling down Cleveland Ave on a Friday evening or Main St during peak hours.  As our community grows and more living spaces are developed this issue will grow in turn.  At a recent joint meeting between City Council and the Planning Commission is was stated that while Newark doesn't qualify for a DelDot traffic study; our City is starting to put plans in place to conduct our own traffic study. I am very hopeful that this study will be carried out by our excellent team of City employees and will shed light on ways we as a community can address the current traffic issues and plan for a future that takes our growth into account.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="parking">
              <p>There are those that say there isn't a parking issue and those that disagree.  As we work together for a more sustainable community that includes increased access for biking and pedestrian traffic some of the parking issues will be addressed simply by a reduction in the amount of cars downtown. However, that doesn't remove the problem all together.  I encourage residents to become more engaged in the parking discussion and having their voices heard on the matter.  Currently there are proposals coming forth to increase parking costs overall downtown, target for specific areas to have an increase, target specific times for parking increases and to possibly add a parking garage.  I want to hear your thoughts on these matters and how it would impact you personally.  I firmly believe that by getting all stakeholders to the table that we can address the parking issues together in an intelligent and thoughtful way.  Our residents, those working on Main St and our community depend on us getting issues like this right. </p>

            <div class="collapse" id="openCommunication">
              <p>It is my plan to communicate more effectively with the residents of District 5 than has been carried out in recent years.  Yes, there are open council meetings and minutes available for the public.  However, many residents do not have the time to attend these meetings or take advantage of listening to the minutes.  It will be my goal as your City Council Rep to make sure all residents are aware of the resources to find the information and communicate City Council happenings in a timely manner.</p>
              <p>We can achieve better open communication in Newark with our local government, but it will take a representative that has the dedication and time to gain feedback from our most important stakeholders, our residents.  As part of my plans for the future of District 5 I will provide monthly meetings to catch up with residents face to face on their concerns as well as provide newsletters both in hard copy and digital format for optimal reach.</p>

              <p>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”  - Margaret Mead</p>
              <p>This is one of my favorite quotes.  In Newark we have many opportunities to engage with our community through various events and programs that strengthen our culture.  I hope to work with residents to continue these great traditions as well as bring a stronger light on more ways residents can make an impact on their local community with quarterly service project offerings and regular updates on Volunteer Opportunities within Newark.  We live in a wonderful community, by working together we can ensure that it stays that way for years to come by engaging our youth and giving all a sense of Newark Pride. </p>

              <p>In reviewing the history of how we came to have an open City Manager slot and the length of time it has taken to replace such an important role in our community I am excited by the current and upcoming progress to fill this position recently shared by the Acting City Manager, City Council and GovHR.  Our City Manager will have a great responsibility and it is integral to place the best fit for Newark in that role.</p>
              <p>Residents have the opportunity to help shape the qualities sought to fill this role and will also be able to review selected candidates.  With my long time experience interviewing candidates for various roles, strengths identification and team optimization I feel very confident that I can lend a sound voice to the selection process and aide in helping the residents and the City of Newark find the best candidate for this very important role.</p>

              <p>Our Community has a great mix of long time native residents, students, business’ and families.  It is of vital importance to represent all residents when looking at the long term goals of the City of Newark and upcoming University expansion.  Our partnership with the University must be strengthened so that both entities are working together to maintain and improve the balance of our community.  While I see many areas where development is needed and would alleviate current issues I also believe that we need to look at all development projects holistically and how neighbors and future neighbors will be impacted by the changes.  We as a community need to come together on ensuring that all development is reviewed for intelligent long term solutions.  While Newark is very lucky to have such an amazing University in our backyards; the University is also very lucky to be surrounded by such an embracing, diverse and inclusive community.  Working together is the only way to make progress with as little negative impact to our mutual history and culture as possible.
