            <div class="collapse" id="referendums">
              <p>On June 19th we will come together and make three important decisions regarding infrastructure plans for the future of Newark.  Up until that time we will be receiving additional information regarding the projects proposed, the costs involved and what the impact will be on our community from our City government. The time leading up to the referendum is an opportunity for residents to make a fully informed decision that will impact the infrastructure of Newark for years to come. I encourage all residents to view and attend any additional information that is released by City Officials and should I earn your vote in April, it will be my responsibility to ensure that the residents of District 5 are informed and up to date on the information coming forward.</p>
              <p>The current plan to borrow ~26.1 million spreads the costs for these projects over many years; lessening an immediate high dollar burden to all residents. The Rodney Stormwater Project includes ~9 million of this number and is only one of the projects we as a community will decide whether to fund.  At face value the location and opportunity to replace the Rodney dorm; not with apartments, but with a stormwater pond to help shore up our flooding issues is very appealing. However I do have concerns about the cost of added amenities. As an environmentalist and supporter of outdoor recreation I see the immense value that such amenities will provide to our area; but I wonder if there are other ways to add those amenities with partnerships and sponsorships as opposed to putting the burden directly onto tax payers. The other two questions we will need to answer tie directly to Water & Sewer projects (~14 million) and other capital projects (~3.1 million).  Spending money on the unseen necessities is never an easy sell; and I fear that a lack of funding for proper maintenance projects historically has led us here.</p>
              <p>While we as a community evaluate the information; I believe that there are some key questions we should focus on: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Will the value add of these projects improve our quality of life at an affordable cost?</li>
                <li>Do we risk increasing damage to our water and sewer systems so that we can save money in the short term? </li>
                <li>Are these projects catching us up to the here and now; or are they also addressing future infrastructure sustainability?</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="collapse" id="traffic">
              <p>After having a lovely and candid conversation with a DelleDonne Representative, Tony; I am very excited for all of us in District 5. We should be seeing a brand new look come October here in the neighborhood; Food Lion is the anchor store and finalization of that is in the works with an announcement from City officials likely to come soon.  Our favorite local pizza joint; Nick & Joe’s as well as The New Number One Chinese and Fairfield Liquors are all slated to be included in the project as well as a major overhaul of the parking lot and facade of course.  I look forward to more information as it becomes available just as much as many of you are I’m sure!  You can find some additional info on the shopping center <a href="http://cmcommercialrealty.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Fairfield-Shopping-Center-Brochure-limited-availability-chart.pdf">here (PDF)</a> as well

            <div class="collapse" id="traffic">
              <p>As I've been attending community meetings and meeting individual residents a piece of feedback I keep receiving is that traffic is a problem that faces us all.  I to know the woes of traveling down Cleveland Ave on a Friday evening or Main St during peak hours.  As our community grows and more living spaces are developed this issue will grow in turn.  At a recent joint meeting between City Council and the Planning Commission is was stated that while Newark doesn't qualify for a DelDot traffic study; our City is starting to put plans in place to conduct our own traffic study. I am very hopeful that this study will be carried out by our excellent team of City employees and will shed light on ways we as a community can address the current traffic issues and plan for a future that takes our growth into account.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="parking">
              <p>There are those that say there isn't a parking issue and those that disagree.  As we work together for a more sustainable community that includes increased access for biking and pedestrian traffic some of the parking issues will be addressed simply by a reduction in the amount of cars downtown. However, that doesn't remove the problem all together.  I encourage residents to become more engaged in the parking discussion and having their voices heard on the matter.  Currently there are proposals coming forth to increase parking costs overall downtown, target for specific areas to have an increase, target specific times for parking increases and to possibly add a parking garage.  I want to hear your thoughts on these matters and how it would impact you personally.  I firmly believe that by getting all stakeholders to the table that we can address the parking issues together in an intelligent and thoughtful way.  Our residents, those working on Main St and our community depend on us getting issues like this right. </p>

            <div class="collapse" id="openCommunication">
              <p>It is my plan to communicate more effectively with the residents of District 5 than has been carried out in recent years.  Yes, there are open council meetings and minutes available for the public.  However, many residents do not have the time to attend these meetings or take advantage of listening to the minutes.  It will be my goal as your City Council Rep to make sure all residents are aware of the resources to find the information and communicate City Council happenings in a timely manner.</p>
              <p>We can achieve better open communication in Newark with our local government, but it will take a representative that has the dedication and time to gain feedback from our most important stakeholders, our residents.  As part of my plans for the future of District 5 I will provide monthly meetings to catch up with residents face to face on their concerns as well as provide newsletters both in hard copy and digital format for optimal reach.</p>

              <p>This is one of my favorite quotes.  In Newark we have many opportunities to engage with our community through various events and programs that strengthen our culture.  I hope to work with residents to continue these great traditions as well as bring a stronger light on more ways residents can make an impact on their local community with quarterly service project offerings and regular updates on Volunteer Opportunities within Newark.  We live in a wonderful community, by working together we can ensure that it stays that way for years to come by engaging our youth and giving all a sense of Newark Pride. </p>

              <p>In reviewing the history of how we came to have an open City Manager slot and the length of time it has taken to replace such an important role in our community I am excited by the current and upcoming progress to fill this position recently shared by the Acting City Manager, City Council and GovHR.  Our City Manager will have a great responsibility and it is integral to place the best fit for Newark in that role.</p>
              <p>Residents have the opportunity to help shape the qualities sought to fill this role and will also be able to review selected candidates.  With my long time experience interviewing candidates for various roles, strengths identification and team optimization I feel very confident that I can lend a sound voice to the selection process and aide in helping the residents and the City of Newark find the best candidate for this very important role.</p>

              <p>Our Community has a great mix of long time native residents, students, business’ and families.  It is of vital importance to represent all residents when looking at the long term goals of the City of Newark and upcoming University expansion.  Our partnership with the University must be strengthened so that both entities are working together to maintain and improve the balance of our community.  While I see many areas where development is needed and would alleviate current issues I also believe that we need to look at all development projects holistically and how neighbors and future neighbors will be impacted by the changes.  We as a community need to come together on ensuring that all development is reviewed for intelligent long term solutions.  While Newark is very lucky to have such an amazing University in our backyards; the University is also very lucky to be surrounded by such an embracing, diverse and inclusive community.  Working together is the only way to make progress with as little negative impact to our mutual history and culture as possible.
